Description of project

"Samvidhan Aur Hum" translates to "The Constitution and Us". It refers to the relationship and understanding between the Indian Constitution (Samvidhan) and the citizens of India. The Constitution is the supreme law of India, outlining the framework for political principles, procedures, and powers of government institutions, as well as the rights and duties of citizens.

We are making website on topic "Samvidhan Aur Hum" in which we make Quiz on  
Civil Laws (e.g., Contracts, Property Rights)
Family Laws (e.g., Marriage, Divorce, Custody)
Labour Laws
Traffic Laws
Environmental Laws
Criminal Laws
Also we make Spin the Wheel: A fun, random selection tool where users spin a wheel to pick an article or section from different law categories. 
This helps in learning about specific laws in an engaging way.
Scenario-Based Game: Users are placed in different real-life legal scenarios and must make decisions based on their understanding of the law. For example:
Civil Law: Tenant vs. Landlord dispute.
Family Law: Child custody in a divorce.
Criminal Law: Reporting a crime.
therefore in short our project "Samvidhan Aur Hum" has a lot of potential to engage people in learning about important laws in India in a fun and interactive
way. By quizzes, games, and educational content.
